- Senior Staff and Senior Engineers lead the way with over 28,000 employees from each department expected to retire soon 
- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, which is 1.71% of the retirement population, or 1 possible mentor for every 58.5 retirees.

## Summary

**How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**

There will be 90,398 roles open in the near future, with three departments around 30% expected to retire soon. The remaining four departments have averages between 8 and 12.5 percent.

**Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**

As it stands there is 1 potential mentor for every 58.5 upcoming retirees, but that is over a 4 year span of retirees. So, if the mentor population doesn't change over the 4 years, then it would be an average of 1 mentor for every 14.6 retirees per year. That seems like a very reasonable number for one person. 

The Manager department has the worse ratio with 0 potential members for the 2 upcoming retirees. With the 2nd worst ratio, Senior engineer has an average of 1 mentor for every 43.5 new hires per year, which seems too stenuous for a retiree to handle. The 3rd worst ratio belongs to Staff with an average of 1 mentor for every 19.7 new hires, which seems managable. So, Manager will need to figure out a mentorship solution - I would recommend from Senior Staff since they have 1 mentor for every 12.4 new hires per year, and losing 1 person would not alter their average. Also, Senior Engineer will need to borrow from elsewhere - I would recommend from Assistant Engineer, which has the highest ratio with 1 mentor for every 5.6 new hires, and is also higher ranked than Engineer (who also has mentors to spare.) With borrowing from other departments, it appears that there are plenty of mentors to help offset the impact of the silver tsunami.
