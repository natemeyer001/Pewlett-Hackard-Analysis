## Summary

**Question: How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**
There will be 90,398 roles open in the near future, with over half of the roles being either Senior Staff or Senior Engineering. Manager has the fewest to replace with only 2. As seen in the picture above, there are 3 departments with around 30% expected to retire soon, and the lowest percentage is 8.33 for Managers.

**Question: Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**
As it stands there is 1 potential mentor for every 58.5 upcoming retirees, but that is over a 4 year span of retirees. So, if the mentor population doesn't change over the 4 years, then it would be an average of 1 mentor for every 14.6 retirees per year. That seems like a very reasonable number for one person. However, the Manager department has 0 potential mentors for the 2 upcoming new hires. Senior engineer has an average of 1 mentor for every 43.5 new hires per year, which seems too stenuous for a retiree to handle. The 3rd worst ratio belongs to Staff with an average of 1 mentor for every 19.7 new hires, which seems managable. So, Manager will need to figure out a mentorship solution - I would recommend from Senior Staff since they have 1 mentor for every 12.4 new hires per year, and losing 1 person would not alter their average. Also, Senior Engineer will need to borrow from elsewhere - I would recommend from Assistant Engineer, which has the highest ratio with 1 mentor for every 5.6 new hires, and is also higher ranked than Engineer (who also has mentors to spare.)
